## Machine Learning

### Models

Regression Models
1. Linear Regression - When prediction is a numeric value for e.g weight of the penguin 
2. Logistic Regression - When prediction is either 1 or 0, yes or no for e.g patient will die or not
    - This can be detected using Sigmoid function
    

Categorization Models
1. Support Vector Machines - Cluster information into categories
2. Decison Trees

All models work on below principles
Data -> Algorithm -> Train -> Model -> Prediction
