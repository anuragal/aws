## Things to do for `AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty` certification

1. Going through the [Linux Academy Course](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/340)
2. Read whitepapers from `AWS SageMaker` and `Kinesis` documentation

## Feedback from people who undertook the test

### Few questions which I have not seen in any training videos/practice papers/AWS training materials/AWS White Papers/AWS Documentation:
1. Given a Residual plot and asked about variance and linear learner model performance
2. Histogram plot and asked what feature engineering needed
3. INVERSE CONFUSION MATRIX i.e. Predicted values at top and Actual values at side (3-questions referencing Confusion Matrix)
4. How to convert right skewed features to normal features
5. How to look at residual plots
6. What happens when you have colinear features)
7. Recognize a Poisson distribution
8. Transfer learning
9. Kernel trick for classification
10. 2 confusion matrices
11. overfit/underfit and what to do to prevent it
12. one about NLP algorithms TF-IDF "vs" word2vec

### Other questions were mostly around this topic:
1. 2-3 questions on Use of Docker container
2. 8-12 questions on Kinesis services
3. ~5 questions on ML
4. 12-15 questions on combination of AWS services (AWS Glue, S3,Kinesis family, Lambda, Polly, Lex, Transcribe, SageMaker etc)
5. 2-3 questions on ML Security
6. 2-5 questions on using Bag Of Words, N-Gram, Tf-Idf, word embeddings (word2vec)
7. 2-3 questions on document analysis/text analysis
8. 1 question on calculating Shards
9. 1 question on calculating Model Accuracy
10. I got lots of questions on which AWS services to choose for real time processing (4-5 on Kinesis), batch ETL, huge ETL jobs (I got 6 or 7 questions just for EMR), Athena, Glue, QuickSight
11. Some questions about IAM, VPC, CloudTrail, CloudWatch. Quite a few on SageMakers but not so many on the algorithms. I didn't get a lot of questions either on AWS managed ML services (Comprehend, Transcribe, ...), maybe one or two. Got a question on AWS Service Catalog as well... well that's the only answers that made sense compared to the others
12. 2-3 questions on docker stuff behind SageMaker

### Highly recommended to read below AWS documentations:
1. AWS SageMaker
2. AWS Kinesis family
3. AWS Polly, Transcribe, Translate, Comprehend, Lex etc
4. Glancing all services under: Machine Laarning, IoT (IoT core, IoT analytics, IoT Greengrass), Analytics (Athena, Data Pipeline, EMR, Glue, QuickSight, Redshift)

### I would definitely recommend giving below Practice papers in Udemy academy:
1. AWS Certified Machine Learningâ€”Specialty 2020 : Full Practice Exam
2. AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty: Full Practice Exam

### If time permits, below AWS free digital training:
1. Exam Readiness: AWS Certified Machine Learning Speciality
2. Elements of Data Science
