## Machine Learning

### Learning Algorithms

#### Supervised Learning
Providing the labeled data which has been provided in-time for learning

1. Labeled data
2. Numeric Data
3. Classified data

#### Un-supervised Learning
Looking for the patterns in the data. For e.g Look at the data and find similar patterns 

#### Reinforcement Learning
Used in robotics and automation. Giving feedback to systems in terms of awards, which enable system learn through type of rewards. The reward can be increasing or decreasing values like +1 or -1

e.g AWS deepracer

### Gradiant Descent

### Regularization
- Apply when model is overfit
- Regularization is achrived through regression

#### L1 Regularization
Uses Lasso Regression
#### L2 Regularization
Ridge Regression

### HyperParameters

#### Learning Rate
- learning rate learning rate determines the size of the step taken during Gradiant descent optimization
- Set between 0 and 1

#### Epochs
- Number of time the algorithms will process the entire dataset
- Each epoch contains one or more batches
- Usaually a high number 10, 100, 1000 or higher

#### Batch Size
- Number of samples used to train at any one time
- Could be all, one or some of your data (batch, stochastic or mini batch)
- often the size is 32, 64, 128, 256 and multiple of it
- Depend on kind of algorithm used, kind of infrastructue used (GPU or CPU Or mutipke servers)

### Cross Validation
