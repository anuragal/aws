To use Boto3, you must first import it and tell it what service you are going to use:
```
import boto3

# Let's use Amazon S3
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
```

Now that you have an s3 resource, you can make requests and process responses from the service. The following uses the buckets collection to print out all bucket names:
```
# Print out bucket names
for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
    print(bucket.name)
```

# Start & Stop Amazon EBS-backed instance
```
import sys
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

instance_id = sys.argv[2]
action = sys.argv[1].upper()

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')


if action == 'ON':
    # Do a dryrun first to verify permissions
    try:
        ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id], DryRun=True)
    except ClientError as e:
        if 'DryRunOperation' not in str(e):
            raise

    # Dry run succeeded, run start_instances without dryrun
    try:
        response = ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id], DryRun=False)
        print(response)
    except ClientError as e:
        print(e)
else:
    # Do a dryrun first to verify permissions
    try:
        ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id], DryRun=True)
    except ClientError as e:
        if 'DryRunOperation' not in str(e):
            raise

    # Dry run succeeded, call stop_instances without dryrun
    try:
        response = ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id], DryRun=False)
        print(response)
    except ClientError as e:
        print(e)
 ```
